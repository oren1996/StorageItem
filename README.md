# StorageItem
I wrote this code to simulate a file storage system that allows users to manage files and folders. In creating this program, I designed two classes: File and Folder, and an enum called SortingField to enable users to sort items based on different criteria. 

I included a variety of methods in each class to facilitate file and folder management. For example, the getSize() method calculates the size of the file or folder, while the addItem() method adds a new item to a folder. Additionally, I incorporated LocalDateTime and DateTimeFormatter classes to generate random dates.

Overall, I aimed to create a user-friendly program that provides efficient file and folder management functionalities.
